# React Native AsyncStorage: Handling Large JSON Objects

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in React Native applications when using AsyncStorage to store large JSON objects.  AsyncStorage has limitations that can cause unexpected behavior such as silent failures, app crashes, or data corruption when handling extensive data.

## The Problem

AsyncStorage is not designed for storing massive JSON objects.  Attempting to do so can result in errors without clear or helpful error messages, making debugging difficult.  This often happens without any visible exception, leading to frustration.

## The Solution

The recommended solution is to use alternative storage methods better suited for managing large datasets. This can include:

* **Realm:** A mobile database solution offering better performance for complex data.
* **SQLite:** A robust database for more complex data management needs.
* **MMKV:** A high-performance key-value storage developed by Tencent.
* **Breaking down the data:** Consider storing the large JSON object in smaller, manageable chunks using multiple AsyncStorage keys.

This repository contains a sample demonstrating the problem and a suggested solution using Realm.
